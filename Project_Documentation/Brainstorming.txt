# Legacy_Friend Project

**Objective:**  
The *Legacy_Friend* project aims to leverage an LLaMA model for analyzing and generating policies, detecting biases, and providing actionable insights to support policy-making. This includes sentiment analysis, topic modeling, fairness analysis, and predictive modeling to drive policy refinement and generation for the server (government) while keeping public welfare and judiciary requirements in focus.

## Model Capabilities

The LLaMA model will perform the following functions:

1. **Sentiment Analysis with Alerting Threshold**  
   Analyze public sentiment and generate alerts when sentiment crosses pre-set thresholds.

2. **Topic Modeling**  
   Identify and model key topics within policy-related data, helping to inform policy creation and refinement.

---

## Expected Model Outputs

Upon processing data, the LLaMA model will produce the following actionable outputs:

1. **Policy Refinement Suggestions**  
   Generate recommendations to improve existing policies based on analysis results, and suggest these to the server.

2. **Policy Generation Suggestions**  
   Identify areas for new policy development and suggest initial policy frameworks to the server.

3. **Policy Outcome Prediction**  
   Predict potential outcomes of proposed policies and communicate these to the server.

4. **Sentiment Alerting**  
   Issue alerts to the server when sentiment metrics exceed a pre-defined threshold, indicating public unrest or strong opinions.

5. **Bias Detection and Fairness Analysis**  
   Perform an analysis to detect biases and evaluate fairness within policies, providing the results on a user-friendly dashboard for quick access.

6. **Conditional Policy Suggestions**  
   - **Existing Policy Solutions:** Search for similar policies in historical data and inform the user if a similar policy solution exists.
   - **New Policy Generation:** If no matching policy exists, generate a new policy recommendation for server-side implementation.

7. **Policy Summarization for User Insights**  
   Summarize key points of policies for user reference using topic modeling results.

## Dashboard Design for Server-Side (Government)

The server-side dashboard will offer a comprehensive visualization of model outputs and analyses, including:

1. **Sentiment Trends of Policies**  
   A line chart illustrating sentiment trends over time for each policy, indicating public response patterns.

2. **Feedback Clusters**  
   Visualize clusters of feedback based on common themes and concerns, shown in an appropriate chart format.

3. **Welfare Impact Prediction**  
   Provide predictive analysis of policy impact on public welfare; if feasible, display this as a chart for better comprehension.

4. **Bias Detection and Fairness Analysis**  
   Generate a report on bias detection and fairness analysis for key public entities, factoring in:
   - Caste
   - Age
   - Gender
   - Religion
   - Income Bracket

   This report will be forwarded to the judiciary for an unbiased review.

## Project Entities

1. **Server-Side (Government)**  
   The main entity responsible for implementing and refining policies based on model outputs.

2. **Userbase (Public)**  
   Provides feedback and sentiment data, which informs the model's analysis and predictions.

3. **Judiciary (3rd-Party Review)**  
   Receives bias and fairness reports to ensure policy decisions are equitable and just.
